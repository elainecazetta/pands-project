    "### About the project: \n",
    "\n",
    "This project was developed as part of the *Programming and Scripting* module. It aims to analize the famous [Fisher's Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) [2], apply basic data processing and visualization techniques, and present meaningful insights using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project requirements are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research the dataset online and write a summary about it in a README file.\n",
    "2. Download the dataset and add it to a GitHub repository.\n",
    "3. Write a program called 'analysis.py' that:\n",
    "  - Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,\n",
    "  - Saves a histogram of each variable as a PNG file, and\n",
    "  - Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.\n",
    "4. Perform any other appropriate analysis, including the creation of a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis performed in this notebook was created to meet the project requirements. It reproduces the same analysis done in the ['analysis.py'](https://github.com/elainecazetta/pands-project/blob/main/analysis.py) file, with additional insights in accordance with item 4 above.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [Iris dataset](https://doi.org/10.24432/C56C76) was created in 1936 by the British statistician and biologist Ronald A. Fisher [3], and it is frequently used for testing classification algorithms and practicing basic data analysis because itâ€™s simple, well-structured, and visually easy to understand [2]. It contains 150 records of iris flowers, with the following features measured in centimeters: [1]\n",
